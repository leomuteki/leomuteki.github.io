### Emmilio Segovia's Portfolio

![Me](https://ibb.co/cEsvPe)

I am about to complete my B.S. in computer science at the University of California Riverside. I am currently looking for a position where I can leverage my experience as a game developer. I really enjoy all aspects of game development including programming, design, 3D modeling, art, and music composition.
